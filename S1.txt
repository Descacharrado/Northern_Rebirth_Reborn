            story= _ "Far to the north of Wesnoth by the dwarven caves of Knalga, there was once a thriving community known as Dwarven Doors. From all over Wesnoth, traders hailing from various surface nations brought plentiful goods for mutual—and peaceful—exchange. Dwarves and humans worked and lived side by side; even the elves who came to trade mingled more with the other races than was common elsewhere. Dwarven Doors grew populous and wealthy."

            story= _ "Knowing that the wealth of their nation might arouse envy from afar, the peoples of the Dwarven Doors built strong fortifications around their settlements, strengthening Knalga against roving bandit gangs and petty warlords. For many years it was indeed so. Dwarven Doors was a peaceful and prosperous place until the orcs came."

            story= _ "The first few orcish forays were no more than mere rabble bashing their skulls against the reinforced gates to Knalga. The humans and dwarves paid them no heed, believing the disorganized orcs to be no threat to their city. But over time, the little incursions grew into raids, then into vicious assaults, as the numerous war-bands pillaged and razed the villages surrounding Dwarven Doors. Then there arose a great warlord among the Bloody Sword tribe, the chieftain called Khazg Black-Tusk, who united a great army of orcs and laid siege to Knalga."

            story= _ "It was a time of doom, of fire, of blood and slaughter. The men and dwarves of the city fought valiantly, felling countless scores of their foes as they held their fortifications unflinchingly. Days passed into weeks, into months, but no matter how long the peoples of Knalga resisted, there were always, it seemed, more orcs to replace the slain. Pleas for help went unheeded in other lands, for they were far away wrapped up in their own affairs and struggles. The defenders of Dwarven Doors stood alone against the innumerable orcish horde."

            story= _ "After a year and a day of grim battle, the city fell. Its streets ran with gore and its walls were painted with blood. Unable to hold back the impetuous onslaught, the dwarves were pushed back into the caverns of Knalga, while the humans of Dwarven Doors who survived the sack were enslaved by the orcs. Cut off from contact with the surface, the dwarves of Knalga fought on, but knew their utter subjugation could not be averted forever."

            story= _ "Dark years passed. Human generations grew up in slavery, worked tirelessly under whip and shackle. As the decades passed, the humans of the north forgot that they had ever been free and nearly lost all hope — until a fateful day in 518YW."

Then, all at once, the war-drums of the orcs began pounding; harsh war-cries sounded as orcs mustered to gather their weapons and man their posts. As the startled peasants looked around in alarm, they saw him."

To his right fought an elderly mage whose deep voice boomed incantations over the clamor of the battle. To his left, glowing with mystic faerie fire and arcane energy, was a great lord of the elves. They were followed closely and supported by a small, but powerful army."

            story= _ "Word quickly spread among the humans that this hero was none other than Prince Konrad of Wesnoth, faring to the ruins of Knalga to retrieve the Sceptre of Fire and use it to save his homeland from the rule of a tyrant. They stood, rooted to their places in awe, watching as the hated orcs fell."

Raising his sword in salute and farewell, he called out to them: <i>“Hold fast your hope, for one day you shall be free!”</i> Then he was gone, and with him, they thought, their dreams of freedom."

By chance, during the young prince's rush through the ruins of Knalga, a small band of his army was captured by the orcs and put to work alongside the peasants. Among them were two magi, Thera and Morvin, who befriended a peasant boy named Tallin."
