S1 - Through the Mists (tentatively complete)

S1x - Renegades
Cutscene

Tallin has not stopped running and entered the woods. He knows the drakes and saurians, and maybe orcs might be pursuing. So he must not stop to rest.

He is then beset by wolves. He thinks this is the end, but is sort of "content" that he is dying a free man. Then suddenly, arrows...and a thrown knife and crossbow bolt fired are heard and then suddenly a small party of orcs and goblins arrive and kill off the wolves.
(already in recall list of side 1 at cutscene start so they can be recalled to their spots)

This is Clan Withervein...or..whatever's left of it. So...after introductions and brief explanations, Tallin is invited to join them as they wish to escape the madness (not like he has a choice)
