# Replayability

This implies if people will play this campaign more than once. Well, the answer is yes.
Certain things have been intentionally progression-locked so that the player can get 100% completion on their third or 4th playthrough.

## Pages of the Grimoire

Throughout the 13 scenarios, there are 5 pages of the grimoire available for pick-up. In S4, S5, S8, S10 and S12. All enchantments are unlocked if you have 12 pages of the grimoire, which makes you wonder, where are the other 7? The answer is replayability. These will be persistently stored so player can all 16 enchantments on their third playthrough.

## Hidden Bosses

Some bosses will not spawn on the first or second playthroughs, thus the end-achievement of these are not obtainable in just one run of the campaign.

## S12 Bonus Bosses:

On the fourth floor of S12, there are 2 closed off chambers. Each has a boss unit. However, on the first playthrough, player can just go through, facing neither. On the second, they fight boss A and on the third, they fight boss B.

## Progression Reset

If on the 4th playthrough, the progression is reset to 0 which is the first starting playthrough.
