Tallin, Zorfu

custom sprite set for Tallin

Currently, the Rogue Mage-line from Liberty is being used however it's not what I has in mind for Tallin
He is pictured 18 years old at the start of this NR/THoT campaign. The Rogue Mage line sort of makes him lose hair and be semi-bald at level 3 which players can get as early as S3. So, losing all hair and looking like an oldman at 18 in just over a few months is absurd.
The level 1 is fine for him but the higher levels of Shadow Mage and Shadow Lord present this "problem"
Thus, maybe 3 new base frames for tallin to be some spellsword type. Doesn't have to be blade melee, but rather maybe a club/mace (since he prefers it more).

attack animations for Drake Smasher, Drake Subjugator
needs a working melee animation for the hammer

enchantment overlay specific icons
maybe for each type or one in general (I just added a recolored thing I found as a placeholder for now)
