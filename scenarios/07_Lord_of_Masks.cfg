    # Setting: within Kal Kartha
    # Lore note: Kal Kartha is known also as the "Kingdom of Forges" so there are a lot of lava pits around. We can add some hidden lore about this in the scenarios.
    # Tallin and co confront Karrag who is exposed. They attack him but after unmasking him, discovers that it was just a steam automaton liek the one they encountered in S2. The same goes for his guards.
