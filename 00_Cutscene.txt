            story= _ "Far to the north of Wesnoth by the dwarven caves of Knalga, there was once a thriving community called Dwarven Doors. Traders hailing from various surface nations brought plentiful goods for mutual and peaceful exchange. Dwarves and humans lived and worked side by side; even the elves mingled more with other races than was common elsewhere. Dwarven Doors grew populous and wealthy."

            story= _ "Knowing that the prosperity of their nation might arouse envy, the peoples of the Dwarven Doors fortified their settlements, strengthening Knalga against roving bandit gangs and petty warlords. For many years, they lived peacefully in the shadows of the mountains. Then, the orcs came."

            story= _ "The first few forays were no more than mere rabble bashing their skulls against the reinforced gates of Knalga. The humans and dwarves paid them no heed, believing the disorganized orcs to be little more than paltry brigands. But over time, the little incursions grew into raids, then into vicious assaults as the numerous war-bands pillaged and razed the villages surrounding Dwarven Doors. Then, there arose a great warlord among the Bloody Sword tribe, a chieftain called Khazg Black-Tusk, who united a vast army of orcs and laid siege to Knalga."

            story= _ "The men and dwarves of the city fought valiantly, defending their fortifications unflinchingly. Days passed into weeks of ceaseless war, but no matter how long the peoples of Knalga resisted, there were always more orcs to replace the slain. Pleas for help from other lands went unheeded, for they were far away wrapped up in their own affairs and struggles. The defenders of Dwarven Doors stood alone against the innumerable orcish hordes."

            story= _ "After a year and a day of grim battle, the city fell. Its streets ran with gore and its walls were painted with blood. Unable to hold back the impetuous onslaught, the dwarves were pushed back into the caverns of Knalga, while the few surviving humans were enslaved by the orcs. The once-mighty Dwarven Doors was no more."

            story= _ "Dark years passed. Human generations grew up in slavery, worked tirelessly under whip and shackle. Although the orcs grew more fragmented after the death of the Black-Tusk, their cruel treatment of the humans became only more oppressive over time. As the decades passed, the humans of the north forgot that they had ever been free and nearly lost all hope."

            story= _ "Then, in 534 YW, a group of adventurers was captured and sent to work in the fields surrounding the ruins of Dwarven Doors. A small dispute arose between two neighboring chieftains over the ownership of the new slaves; after a few less-than-peaceful negotiations, the chieftains agreed to split the humans between them, although they kept a wary eye on each other thereafter. Among those sent to the Wolf-Fang clan were two magi, Thera and Morvin, who befriended a recently-traded peasant boy named Tallin."
